### About me

I started studying at **[RSScholl](https://rs.school/)** in order to change my field of activity. I hope that I will be able to become a good developer, even though I have not studied programming before. 

### Education and work experience

I studied at **BSUIR** as a radio engineer. But I never got any work experience in my specialty. Now I work in the field of construction and repair.
